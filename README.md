# Brain Tumor MRI Analysis Project
## Overview
This project implements deep learning approaches for brain tumor detection and classification using MRI images. The system performs two main tasks:

1. Classification of brain tumors into different types (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor)
2. Segmentation of tumor regions within MRI scans
